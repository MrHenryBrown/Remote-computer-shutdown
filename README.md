# Remote-computer-shutdown

Love to watch autoplay movies and TV shows but hate getting out of bed to turn off your computer? Then this is the program for you!

The program can remotely shutdown your computer from any device (if the device and the computer are on the same network).

## It requires

### Start the server on your computer along with the series

- Open a file called startWin (startWin.bat if you work from windows operating system) or start (start.sh if work from other systems)

### Go to the specified address from any device

- The address is shown in the picture (http:\\\\192.168.43.82:3000):

### Set the timer or stop it (especially for "well, this is definitely the last episode")

### By double tapping on the screen, you can turn vibration on and off

P. s. To start, you must also download the <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">Node js</a>.

Happy viewing! :)
